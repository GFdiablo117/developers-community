### Introduction

Brands can provide LivePerson's Conversational Builder Bots a consumer (OAuth 2.0) access token. This token can later be used to access the brand's APIs in the context of the consumer.  
This can be done in order to accomplish many business and operational use cases on which Bots integrates with brand's APIs such as:
* to enrich conversation by retrieving information about the consumer.
* to making an operation on behalf of the user
